Assumptions made:
1, All cars or passengers will be removed 10 frames after health reaches 0 or below to finish post-collision movements.
2, All fireballs are generated X frames above the enemy car that generates it, where X is the sum of their radii.
3, Assuming picked-up passengers are positioned 50 pixels away from the driver upon ejection throughout.
